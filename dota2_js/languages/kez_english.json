  "kez_newhero_description": "When it comes to strategy, Kez tends to wing it â€” he's able to swap on the fly between his katana and sai to slash, dash, swoop, and parry as the needs of the battlefield demand.<br><br>But when he puts his mind to it, he can account for any eventuality. Kez has the right tool for every job (assuming he remembers in time what the right tool is), and can choose to attack, escape or simply outwit his enemies with a little advance planning.",

  "kez_ability_description": "Kez has two sets of weapons, so it's only fitting that he has two sets of abilities to match. One set is available while he's brandishing his Kazurai Katana and the other when wielding his Shodo Sai. Each weapon set also features unique effects when attacking, but it's all way too fun to spoil here in mere words, so we recommend looking below instead for an actual peek at Kez in action.",
