      "The International doesn't just draw near. Like a supernatural clockwork carnival barker out in a dark forest, it beckons. We're two weeks away from the first games of The International Group Stage, and if you're a fan of professional esports, it's time to get excited. Floor tickets for all three days are sold out, but some arena seats are [url=https://www.ticketmaster.dk/artist/941884]still available[/url]. Whether you've already bought your tickets or you're holding out until the last possible minute, we look forward to seeing you at Copenhagen's Royal Arena in September.",
      "As our annual lead-up to the big event, we've just released this year's [url=https://www.dota2.com/international2024]International Compendium[/url]. We even called in a favor with our newest old friend, who graciously volunteered to walk everyone through it. For those of you new to The International, the Compendium is a collection of activities and rewards focused on the players, teams, and matches in this year's tournament. Out-predict, out-fantasy, and out-bingo your friends while you watch â€” all while earning TI-themed rewards ranging from a new HUD to brand-new heroic effigies and a flashy new versus screen to show them off on.",
      "Lastly, as you may have noticed by our clever introductory allusions, or by looking at the image above, or by clicking any of the links in this post, or by launching Dota before reading this, today's update also includes our newest hero: Cogliostro Kettle, [b][url=https://www.dota2.com/international2024]The Ringmaster[/url][/b], has arrived. He's here, he's free, and he's available to all players right now. ",
      "But why introduce him further, when he's happy (believe us, [i]more [/i]than happy) to introduce himself? [url=https://www.dota2.com/ringmastercomic]Read on[/url] for his tragic backstory."
