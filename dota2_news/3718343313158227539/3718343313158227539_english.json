      "Doors open at the arena at 8 AM daily, two hours before Friday's 10 AM opening ceremony and Saturday's and Sunday's 10 AM first matches start. Be ready to scan your Ticketmaster pass to gain entry (you can save it to your Android/Apple phone wallet for convenience). Make sure you grab a daily wristband once you're in, so you can re-enter if you leave.",

(Just a heads-up, their bag policy is pretty strict.) The Arena Guide also has plenty of helpful information with regards to accessibility options, parking and other info you might need getting around the venue, so be sure to give it a look before you go.",

Inside each bag is a commemorative badge that has the information, URL, and binding code to tie your Steam account for Crimson Witness drops. This year’s event-exclusive treasure includes updated Immortal items for Dark Seer, Underlord, Templar Assassin, Centaur Warrunner, Enchantress, Nature's Prophet, and Witch Doctor. ",

      "You'll get your one drop automatically upon binding the badge, and be eligible for drops the rest of the weekend whenever first blood is drawn in a match. The swag bag, being of necessity bag-shaped, is a carved-out exception to the arena's bag policy for re-entry. Customers will be able to re-enter the venue with it.",
