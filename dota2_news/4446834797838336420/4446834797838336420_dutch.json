      "Today's update is as big as it gets. Not only are we releasing the fourth and final act of our multi-part Crownfall epic, we're celebrating with the debut of Kez, an all-new playable hero!",
      "[h2]Hero of the Flightless[/h2]",
      "If you helped out Vengeful Spirit in Crownfall Act III, you already trekked your way through the icy tundras of Icewrack, found the Skywrath exile Kez, and convinced him to return home with you. In Act IV, he plans to reband the Kazurai and help you rid Skywrath of Imperia once and for all. And when he's not helping you commit regicide, he'll be all too happy to lend his blades to a little freelance work carving up some Ancients. ",
      "With the innate ability to swap weapon styles between his Kazurai Katana and Shodo Sai (unlocking more powers than there are days in the week), this martial master's kit comes with tons of options. Check out [url=https://www.dota2.com/kez]Kez's landing page[/url] to learn more about everything he can bring to the fight.",
      "[h2]Crownfall Act IV: The Spires of Skywrath[/h2]",
      "Princess Shen was first in line for the throne of Skywrath when her father, King Tatrasiel, fell ill and died. But her younger sister Imperia betrayed her, cast her from the highest tower of the Nest and left her for dead. She was found by the Flightless goddess Scree'Auk, and given the powers of a Vengeful Spirit.",
      "  ",
      "Today, the resurrected Shen returns to Skywrath to battle her sister for the fate of the throne. And she will not be alone. All the heroes who have helped her along the way, from Dragonus to Axe to Kez to Crystal Maiden and more, will battle their way through three separate paths up the spires of Skywrath to the Nest of Thorns, where Imperia awaits for a final battle.",
      "Crownfall Act IV is the epic conclusion to a journey that's taken us from the humble markets of Midgate to the rolling red sands of Druud and the wastes of the frozen north, and finally to the Nest of Thorns, the courtroom of the queen herself, for an ultimate showdown. Act IV boasts a massive new overworld map with three distinct questing paths, sidequests, minigames, and finally, a chance to defeat Imperia and unlock new Skywrath Mage and Vengeful Spirit Arcana alternate styles. So get ready for plenty of royal treasury looting along the way to the palace.",
      "We've also got new Act IV-specific Pathfinder rewards, including custom Crownfall Scree'Auk and Avilliva towers and new Immortals. We've even added bonus content for Pathfinder pack owners for each act. You can now visit the Snake Charmer in Shen's questline in Act IV to claim your limited edition Crownfall character stickers. ",
      "[h2]Getting Caught Up[/h2]",
      "If you've been playing along through Crownfall as each act releases and want to jump right into the new Act IV content, don't forget to read the latest intro comic, \"[url=https://www.dota2.com/crownfall/comic4]Crownfall[/url]\", before you start. And if you wouldn't mind a quick refresher of what, precisely, the hell is going on, feel free to read up on Act I's intro, \"[url=https://www.dota2.com/crownfall/comic]Ascension Day[/url]\", Act II's, \"[url=https://www.dota2.com/crownfall/comic2]The Battle of Hell's Basin[/url]\" and Act III's \"[url=https://www.dota2.com/crownfall/comic3]The Dragon[/url]\". ",
      "[h2]It's All Live![/h2]",
      "Lastly, if you're just joining us now for the closing act of Crownfall... welcome! All of the previous acts are still available, and will remain so until Crownfall comes to a close January 15th, 2025, so there's still plenty of time to get started and a ton of content waiting for you.",
      "That goes for the rest of you, too. If you've been puttering with the previous acts but waiting for everything to be available first, wait no longer. The entirety of Crownfall is now yours for the exploring. Work through all the maps, unravel the entire story, play all the games and unlock all the arcana styles. ",
      "...And, of course, spend all your coins and candy. For those of you sitting on any Crownfall Coins (or those of you planning to earn more playing through Act IV), remember to use them before the event ends on January 15th."
