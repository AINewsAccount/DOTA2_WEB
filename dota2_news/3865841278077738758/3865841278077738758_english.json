      "We'd gorged on a feast of bluehorn and spiced creep,",

      "When up on the roof, with a house-shaking thud",
      "A creature had landed, and sniffed for our blood.",
      "A sword could be heard being dragged 'cross the shingles;",
      "Then the chimney exploded, and in came King Kringle.",
      "His silhouette stalked through the splintered debris",
      "Of branches and cinders where'd once been our tree.",
      "He righted an armchair (still quietly smoldering)",
      "And sat down with three sacks he'd been up till now shouldering.",
      "\"[b]A DARK INCANTATION,[/b]\" his hollow voice boomed",
      "Like a sepulchral drum being banged in a tomb.",
      "\"[b]A SACK OF GIFTS PRESENT, A SACK OF GIFTS PAST,",
      "A SACK OF GIFTS TAKEN (BUT OFTEN BROUGHT BACK).[/b]\"",

      "THE MOONLIGHT TIARA, AND MUCH MORE,[/b]\" he said.",
