They've been guessing for months what would be in it. And now... we're finally shipping it.\n\nThat's right: Crownfall Act II's fishing game is LIVE! \n\nFor those of you who didn't just die of adrenaline shock, we also shipped a massive new gameplay patch, which you might want to read up on. Go find out more about 7.36 [url=https://dota2.com/patches/7.36]here[/url].\n\nWe also shipped the second part of Crownfall, this time taking place in the unforgiving deserts of Druud. There's a new overworld map, a new story, some new characters (and some familiar favorites), new cosmetic items, new minigames, and more than a few surprises.\n\nLastly, in case you got busy last month (it happens) and were wondering if you'll still be able to play Crownfall Act I now that Act II's shipped: You can. All of Crownfall's acts will be available as new acts come online, up to the conclusion of the event.\n\nOK, that's probably enough fishing and fishing-adjacent (7.36, Crownfall Act II) news for one update.  What are you waiting for? Boot up the game and get angling!\n",
