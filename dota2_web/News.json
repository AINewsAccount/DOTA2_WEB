You might remember [url=https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/3692442542242977036]back in September[/url], we got out the ban hammer and permanently banned 90,000 smurf accounts. Since then, we've continued to invest in player behavior monitoring, on both the manual and automatic analysis fronts. Over the last few weeks, we've engaged in an even more aggressive ban wave, including many tens of thousands of smurf account bans today alone.\n\nAt The International, some pro players reached out to us to talk about their smurf accounts. Those conversations have continued, and there’s broad agreement amongst pros that banning pro smurf accounts is a win for Dota as a community: The rules should apply to everybody, and from now on they will. And smurfing isn’t even the only naughty thing players are getting up to. Amongst other questionable choices, some bad actors are playing like jerks, ruining games and losing behavior score because of it, then hiring behavior score farmers to drive it back up.\n\nRegardless of [i]how[/i] you’ve been naughty, we've been watching you (not while you're sleeping, calm down) and we’re cracking down on all of it. Punishments will be handed out for all of the above, including behavior score penalties — and in serious cases, main account bannings. \n\nAs we’ve said before, smurfing (and other negative behavior) makes matches worse, and we want to make sure your matches are as good as possible as we head into the new year. So we’d like to wish everyone a [url=https://www.dota2.com/frostivus2023]Happy Frostivus Update![/url] Except smurf accounts, who we assume will not enjoy the update as they choke on their richly-deserved coal-flavored just desserts.\n\n[b]Bug Fixes:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Fixed an issue where if a hero killed in Chronosphere dropped Gem of True Sight, the Gem's cooldown would remain frozen\n[*]Fixed a rare crash with item combines\n[*]Fixed an issue where if an ability with a frozen cooldown had its cooldown frozen again, it would unfreeze too early\n[*]Fixed an issue where abilities with intrinsic buffs could fail to have them applied when purchasing Aghanim's Shard\n[*]Fixed an issue where switching abilities (or gaining Aether Lens etc.) wouldn't update the cast range circle if it was already being displayed\n[*]Fixed Chaos Knight's Chaos Bolt particles sometimes losing their location\n[*]Fixed Dawnbreaker's Starbreaker providing pure damage immunity without Aghanim's Shard\n[*]Fixed Earthshaker's Bindings of Deep Magma set to show the correct (new) particles for the new (10th Anniversary) style and to properly delete particles on expiration\n[*]Fixed Hoodwink's Bushwhack cast reticule sometimes highlighting trees outside the area of effect\n[*]Fixed some animation issues with Tusk's Walrus PUNCH!\n[*]Fixed a bug where Vengeful Spirit's Magic Missile with Aghanim's Shard could bounce to  invisible enemies immune to True Sight\n[*]Fixed an issue with the Voodoo Restoration particles on Witch Doctor's Awaleb's Trundleweed Immortal weapon\n[*]Fixed highlighting on the Neutral Item Slot to only highlight when there is at least one free token in the stash, rather than any item from any teammate\n[*]Fixed an issue where casting an ability with Alt held down would also ping\n[*]Fixed lifetime timers for wards and summoned units being clipped in the HUD\n[*]Fixed talent descriptions sometimes being blocked by hotkey names\n[*]Fixed Tower denies appearing as chat messages rather than as combat events\n[*]Fixed stickers showing as available in Armory even though the capsule containing the stickers might not be available\n[*]Fixed showing sticker capsules from ended events as purchasable\n[*]Fixed Item Received popup not showing global items properly\n[*]Fixed an issue with Play Unranked where ticking Show All Modes could make the section unusable\n[*]Fixed sometimes showing pro players' Steam persona names instead of the correct names\n[*]Fixed long names overflowing in History and Battle Stats pages\n[*]Added an additional notification for Workshop custom game authors that have not yet updated their custom models away from the deprecated pre-ModelDoc format, as described in the [url=https://www.dota2.com/springcleaning]2022 Spring Cleaning update[/url] and the [url=https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/3659774959159800240]Dead Reckoning Update[/url]\n[/list]",

We've locked up Climate Pledge Arena, we've all seen enough of Spirit Breaker, and we've just shipped Gameplay Update 7.34e. Time for the Dota team to settle down for a long winter's nap, and...\n\nBut hark! What's that sound in the festive distance? No, that jingling of sleigh bells you hear isn't early onset tinnitus. It's the magical year-end event we call Frostivus — looming large on the December calendar, and arriving with a sack stuffed to bursting with new features, new cosmetics, and some surprises.\n\n\"...and the Arcanas?\" little Timmy asks hopefully, holding up his tiny Dickensian gruel bowl. Phew, this is awkward. No, Timmy, not yet. All cards on the table, the event surrounding the Arcanas this year has gained a few more moving parts than we initially planned. Enough that we haven't finished everything yet, and won't this year, but we're looking forward to releasing it in the next few months.
