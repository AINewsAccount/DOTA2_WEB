It's kind of crazy, then, that it's taken more than a decade for us to finally prove that bold claim by saying it out loud in print. \n\nAnd if that was all we did, it would be enough. But we didn't stop there. We've re-made the river that runs through the Dota map. Not only is it wider, its current can speed your movement. Conversely, the new river's new evolving, amphibious creeps can drastically slow your movement by killing you.\n\nAnd that's not all: How about a new resource! \"Waterstone?\" you say. In retrospect, that would have made sense. But it's actually called \"Madstone\" and you can use it to craft your own unique neutral items. Which is crazy, so the name actually fits pretty well.\n\nWe've also made some other map updates, replaced wisdom runes with much cooler wisdom shrines, and made a bunch of quality of life changes. It's all too much to detail in one blog post, which means you'd be out of luck unless we made a page dedicated to describing all the stuff in great detail.
