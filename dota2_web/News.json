Why? Because Spring is terrible. It's too warm to ski, too cold to swim, it rains a lot, and there aren't even any free-candy monster holidays like you get in the Fall. \n\nIn fact, the only good thing about Spring is Dota's sometimes-annual Spring Update. So the good news is it's here, it's called [url=https://www.dota2.com/springforward2025]Spring Forward 2025[/url], and it's pretty great this year! The bad news: this marks the point of Spring where there's nothing left to look forward to. Hopefully you can just power-Dota your way through to Summer.",
