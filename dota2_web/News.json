And since the only thing as fun as playing Dota is savoring those signature plays with friends, today we're excited to roll out [url=https://steampowered.com/gamerecording]Game Recording[/url], a new built-in Steam feature that makes sharing those special Dota moments easier than ever before.\n\nGame Recording lets you save your gameplay — either by recording in the background or manual hotkey activation — to replay at your convenience. Recordings in Dota 2 will include a timeline filled with game-defined markers, but you can also add your own markers at any point. Scrub through a recording while you're still playing to review things like confusing teamfights or a failed gank, or take your time after the game to find the most entertaining moments and memes-to-be that you want to share. You can easily clip the good stuff and discard the rest. Snipping and sharing your clips with friends is just a few clicks away.\n\nReady to get rolling? Simply opt into the Steam Beta Update in your Steam Interface Settings to join the fun. You'll be clipping and shipping highlights in no time. Need a bit more info on how it works? Head over to the [url=https://steampowered.com/gamerecording]Steam Game Recording[/url] webpage for more in-depth details. Then start sharing your clips through Steam or wherever you chat with your friends — we're excited to see what you make! And if you run into any issues or feel the feature is missing something, please share those thoughts as well. In the meantime, we'll keep working on improvements as the Beta moves towards full Steam release, and we'll also continue looking at ways to enhance how Dota specifically can make use of all the new features.",

Filmmakers will have until 3:00pm PDT on August 18, 2024 to submit their short film creations of 90 seconds or less to the Dota 2 Steam Workshop to be eligible for consideration.\n\nAll Dota players are welcome to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/dota2shortfilm]visit the Workshop[/url] to discuss, vote on their favorites, and help us select the best entries. The top ten finalists will be showcased as part of The International live broadcast. After reviewing the Workshop ratings and discussions, Valve will nominate the top entries to be featured in the Dota client for a final voting process by the community to determine the winners.\n\nThe top three selections will score prizes of $25,000, $10,000, and $5,000, and each of the other top ten finalists will win $500. (As a refresher for anyone who missed the winners last year, or wants to enjoy them again, the top three entries from last year were [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELyf2AYq8Zg]Chemical Rage[/url] by 4fun, [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtVOAtCAkPU]Finish Pls[/url] by Keller Max, and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GxMmEMSjTg]GAME BREAKERS[/url] by Anomidae.)\n\nVisit the [url=https://www.dota2.com/filmcontest]Dota 2 Short Film Contest[/url] site for more information and guidelines on the submission process. And be sure to stop by the Workshop page regularly to help review the submissions you would like to see showcased at The International, coming to you live from Copenhagen in September.",
