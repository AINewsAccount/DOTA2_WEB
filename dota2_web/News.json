This fearsome squad dropped only two games the entire tournament — finishing with a decisive 3-0 performance in the Grand Finals to secure their spot as the best Dota team in the world.\n\n[b]The Road to The International - Group Stage[/b]\n[url=https://www.dota2.com/esports/ti12/watch/15728/70/game1vod]The Road to The International[/url] began with a dominating 8-0 showing from Spirit, as they racked up 2-0 series wins over 9pandas, SMG, Entity, and Evil Geniuses in the Group Stage. The seeding round would be no different, as Team Spirit endured some early pickoffs from Shopify Rebellion in game one before marching away with another 2-0 series victory on their way to the Playoffs.\n\n[b]The Road to The International - Playoffs[/b]\nThere, they faced their first major test of the tournament, as Virtus.pro snatched a quick victory in game one to force Spirit onto their heels for a change. The following match was a bloody affair in which Spirit built and lost a sizeable lead before reclaiming momentum to force a game three. VP managed to keep the rubber match close for 30 minutes, despite never earning a lead, but after that Spirit took control — choking out VP and sealing the series with a late-game team wipe to earn some well-deserved rest before taking their run to the main stage at Climate Pledge Arena.\n\n[b]The International[/b]\nTeam Spirit's first opponent on the main stage was the consistently-strong Team Liquid, who were looking to make their own deep run to the finals to erase a heartbreaking stretch of second-place results. Team Spirit harried Liquid's supports and bullied their cores in a game-one stomp, but Liquid fought back with a spectacular showing to take game two. Liquid then managed to scratch out a small lead by the middle of game three, but Spirit overcame a kill deficit to build their own insurmountable lead, taking the deciding match to set the stage for a clash with powerhouse LGD Gaming — an intimidating lineup that had only dropped a single match of their own at that point in play.\n\nGame one was a 76-minute brawl. LGD was aggressive early, but Team Spirit held firm before starting to take control. LGD kept clawing back, but Spirit skewered their chances, handing LGD their first loss on the main stage. Game two was Spirit's from the outset, as they steadily built an advantage and forced a tap-out from LGD. After a disappointing showing in Singapore in 2022, Team Spirit showed they'd regained top form as they stormed into the Grand Finals.\n\nTheir opponents: the dangerous Gaimin Gladiators, the squad that swept this year's Major tournaments and whose in-your-face early-game tactics had already shattered the hopes of so many lower bracket teams.\n\nUnfortunately for Gaimin and their fans, Team Spirit had their own plans to make short work of their foes — they ran away with a relatively quick game one, building a huge gold and kill lead that left no avenue for comeback by GG. Game two proved a more back-and-forth contest, with Gaimin Gladiators earning a few small leads before Team Spirit broke through to completely dominate the late game and take a commanding 2-0 series lead. \n\nNot about to go down without a fight, Gaimin Gladiators managed to take hold of game three early. By 30 minutes, even Dota+ thought GG had a 95% chance to force a game four... but Team Spirit's movement, vision, and team coordination seized that 5% chance and turned it into a stunning comeback, bulldozing GG 3-0 in the Grand Finals to secure their second Aegis in three years and welcome their mid-laner Larl to the champions club. Through both incredible individual talent and stellar team play, Team Spirit cemented their place in Dota 2 history as the last team standing at The International 2023.\n\nAs bearers of the ultimate symbol of victory, these names shall forever be inscribed upon the Aegis of Champions:\n\n[b]2023 - Team Spirit[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Illia \"Yatoro雨\" Muliarchuk\n[*] Denis \"Larl\" Sigitov\n[*] Magomed \"Collapse\" Khalilov\n[*] Myroslav \"Mira\" Kolpakov\n[*] Yaroslav \"Miposhka\" Naidenov\n[/list]\n\n[b]Looking Back[/b]\nIf you missed any of the tournament, or just want to relive the incredible moments and plays, head over to the [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/dota2]Dota 2 YouTube channel[/url], where you can find replays of the entire tournament, including broadcast content from between the games. You can also find a stash of photos from the event over on the [url=https://www.instagram.com/dota2]Dota 2 Instagram[/url] and [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/dota2ti/]Dota 2 flickr[/url].\n\nWe would like to thank all of the players, talent, and everyone in the Dota community for helping bring this celebration to life. The International is the crowning moment of the competitive season, and without everyone’s support, none of this would be possible. We hope you enjoyed this year’s tournament as much as we did.\n\n[b]Celebrate the Champions[/b]\nSpecial Champion edition sticker capsules are now available for purchase for Team Spirit. Each capsule contains one sticker featuring Yatoro雨, Larl, Collapse, Mira, Miposhka, or Team Spirit. 50% of all sales goes directly to Team Spirit.\n\n[b]The International Compendium[/b]\nStill have some challenges to complete and rewards to claim in The International 2023 Compendium? Don't panic. You've got two more weeks to hit your goals before the Compendium wraps up on November 16. Pull out some of your favorite new TI strats and you'll have things locked up in no time.\n",

Congratulations to all eight teams as they vie to capture the Aegis at [b]The International[/b] — only at Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle, WA, and now only a day away.\n\n[h2]Watching The International Live[/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3703047/3401f831b86a8fd94c51f1db8682b11a5ee6da11.jpg[/img]\n\n[h5]TI 2023 Schedule[/h5]\nThe International Pre-show starts at 9:30 AM PDT on Friday, October 27th, with the Opening Ceremony starting at 10 AM and the first match soon after. Click [url=https://www.dota2.com/esports/ti12/schedule]here[/url] for the full TI 2023 schedule.\n\n[h5]Getting In[/h5]\nDoors open at the arena at 8 AM daily, two hours before Friday's 10 AM opening ceremony and Saturday's and Sunday's 10 AM first matches start. Be ready to scan your Ticketmaster pass to gain entry (you can save it to your Android/Apple phone wallet for convenience). Make sure you grab a daily wristband once you're in, so you can re-enter if you leave.\n\n[h5]Getting Around[/h5]\nClimate Pledge Arena is a pretty big place. If you're planning on attending in person, here's a handy [url=https://climatepledgearena.com/arena-guide/]Arena Guide[/url] to light your path. (Just a heads-up, their bag policy is pretty strict.) The Arena Guide also has plenty of helpful information with regards to accessibility options, parking and other info you might need getting around the venue, so be sure to give it a look before you go.\n\n[h5]Seating[/h5]\nSeating is General Admission — you can sit in almost any available seat other than sections reserved for press and pros.\n\n[h5]Crimson Witness Treasure Drops[/h5]\nThere are multiple swag bag stations inside the arena once you get in. Each pass holder can pick up one swag bag for the weekend by scanning their pass. Inside each bag is a commemorative badge that has the information, URL, and binding code to tie your Steam account for Crimson Witness drops. This year’s event-exclusive treasure includes updated Immortal items for Dark Seer, Underlord, Templar Assassin, Centaur Warrunner, Enchantress, Nature's Prophet, and Witch Doctor. \n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3703047/c9e2e3273df406745fdda143b7348fa5d9ca5350.png[/img]\n\nYou'll get your one drop automatically upon binding the badge, and be eligible for drops the rest of the weekend whenever first blood is drawn in a match. The swag bag, being of necessity bag-shaped, is a carved-out exception to the arena's bag policy for re-entry. Customers will be able to re-enter the venue with it.\n\n[h2]Watching The International Online[/h2]\n\nIf you're one of the millions of Dota fans around the globe planning to watch The International online, check out the list below.

And now, four intense days, four eliminations, 57 godlike sprees, six rampages, 104 heroes picked, and 100 total matches later, eight teams now sit in the upper bracket and eight in the lower, with mere hours before the real fight begins. \n\nThat’s right: It’s Playoffs time. If you're a ticket holder, doors open at the Seattle Convention Center’s Summit at 9 AM PDT on Friday, October 20th. The pre-show and livestream start at 9:30 AM PDT, with matches starting at 10 AM PDT.\n\nIf you missed Group Stage last weekend and want to get caught up on which team to root for, which teams to watch out for, and which team the [i]other[/i] teams better watch out for over Playoffs weekend, here's a [url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxkyNsoBqOdD68FyLdCUsK1-TKSYDkXzi]YouTube playlist[/url] featuring insights into the playoff contenders. \n\nIf you're a fan of supporting talent and/or spamming their voice lines in every match of Dota you play, we’ve got good news for you. Some talent missed the initial submission window, but luckily were able to get their content submitted during a new redundant backup emergency submission window we created just for them. This means there are some brand new bundles for talent that were missing from the initial set, and also some new lines for some existing talent.\n \nAnd don’t think we forgot about one of The International’s most popular traditions: Crimson Witness. This year’s event-exclusive treasure includes updated Immortal items for Dark Seer, Underlord, Templar Assassin, Centaur Warrunner, Enchantress, Nature's Prophet, and Witch Doctor. You’ll automatically be granted one Treasure of the Crimson Witness simply by binding your Steam account to your pass for the Main Event at Climate Pledge Arena. By attending either Playoffs this weekend or The International next weekend, you’ll also have a chance to get a random Crimson Witness treasure drop whenever first blood is drawn in a match.\n\nSee you this weekend!\n",
