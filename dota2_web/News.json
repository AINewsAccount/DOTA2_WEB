With a community of talented artists contributing lots of new stuff that we shipped throughout the year, sales of community-generated Workshop content generated more revenue for contributors in 2024 than any year since 2015—and that community of talented artists could also include you!\n\nThat's right: We're once again inviting all workshop contributors to spin up some new sets for any of your favorite heroes—including two newcomers who have been waiting eagerly in the wings to join the cosmetic fun. Artists can also include submissions for both Ringmaster and Kez, who are now enabled in the workshop.\n\nTo be considered, we request that all submissions be on the Dota 2 Workshop by the end of day on April 6th, 2025 PDT. Please make sure to mark your work with the \"Spring 2025\" tag when tendering items to the Workshop to ensure they aren't overlooked. (As usual, please avoid concepts involving human skulls, blood, and gore.)\n\nDota fans everywhere are of course encouraged to regularly visit the Workshop and vote through the Queue to ensure your voices are heard in the hunt for the treasures of tomorrow.\n",

War trumpets, battered but resolute, are buffed with war trumpet polish until they gleam. Weapons, resolute but dull, are sharpened on whetstones in rhythmic strokes, until they are perhaps too sharp, and dulled up a little on nearby flagstones so no one cuts themselves.  The banners (tattered, resolute and unfurled, see earlier) are hoisted high, their sigils stitched with sequins of the most defiant bedazzlement.\n\nThat's right. The stars have aligned and the stage is once again being set for cosmic battle. And this time, that battle has returned to where it all began: Germany, the site of The International's humble debut on the world stage, where it was watched in person by many tens of people. Now, fourteen years later, The International returns to Germany, to Hamburg's Barclays Arena September 11 - 14 — in front of, we trust, a slightly bigger crowd this time around.\n\nThe sixteen contending teams will once again consist of a mix of open qualifiers, regional qualifiers, and direct invitations, with more information on all of that to come. For now, there's still a ton of professional Dota to be played before we can get there. The January viewing calendar has already been packed, as teams around the world fight through qualifiers to earn spots in tournaments slated to kick off in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nStay tuned for more information on ticketing and scheduling for The International 2025. Until then, [url=https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Portal:Tournaments]tune into some of the pro games[/url] to get an early edge on knowing who's who and clocking the teams to beat.",
