(Previously, the cutoff was 6500 MMR, roughly the top 1.5% of players.)\n[*] Immortal Draft games do not show up in public match history. Replay access is restricted to game participants, and these games are not listed in Web APIs.\n[*] Players who are above 8500 MMR (the top 0.5% of players) are now required to register an official name to queue for ranked. This name cannot be changed and will be displayed during the pre-game player draft phase of Immortal Draft games. Approximately half of players at this rank already have an official name registered.\n[*] Players above 8500 MMR who are guaranteed to play an Immortal Draft game may not queue for ranked as a party. Unranked is unchanged.\n[*] Changed the way MMR gain/loss works in Immortal Draft games to better take into consideration the possible outcomes based on player draft choices.\n[/list]\n\n[b]In summary:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] If your MMR is 8500+, all of your ranked games will be Immortal Draft. All matches will be private. You're required have an official name registered. You cannot queue for ranked matches as a member of a party. Unranked is unchanged.\n[*] If your MMR is 6500+, your ranked games will only be Immortal Draft if matched with a player above 8500 MMR. Otherwise you'll play using standard ranked match rules. Unranked is unchanged.\n[/list]",
