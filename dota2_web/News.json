Why? Because Spring is terrible. It's too warm to ski, too cold to swim, it rains a lot, and there aren't even any free-candy monster holidays like you get in the Fall. \n\nIn fact, the only good thing about Spring is Dota's sometimes-annual Spring Update. So the good news is it's here, it's called [url=https://www.dota2.com/springforward2025]Spring Forward 2025[/url], and it's pretty great this year! The bad news: this marks the point of Spring where there's nothing left to look forward to. Hopefully you can just power-Dota your way through to Summer.",

A select number of those creations even made grand debuts on the main stage of The International, broadcast to viewers around the world. \n\nThis year will be no different! In fact, we're happy to declare the [url=https://www.dota2.com/filmcontest]Dota 2 Short Film Contest[/url] officially open for a new round of submissions. Filmmakers will have until 3:00pm PDT on August 17th, 2025 to submit their short film creations of 90 seconds or less to the Dota 2 Steam Workshop to be eligible for consideration.\n\nAll Dota players are welcome to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/dota2shortfilm?snr=___]visit the Workshop[/url] to discuss, vote on their favorites, and help us select the best entries. The top ten finalists will be showcased as part of The International live broadcast. After reviewing the Workshop ratings and discussions, Valve will nominate the top entries to be featured in the Dota client for a final voting process by the community to determine the winners.\n\nThe top three selections will score prizes of $25,000, $10,000, and $5,000, and each of the other top ten finalists will win $500.
