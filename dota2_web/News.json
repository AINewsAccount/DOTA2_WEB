They've been guessing for months what would be in it. And now... we're finally shipping it.\n\nThat's right: Crownfall Act II's fishing game is LIVE! \n\nFor those of you who didn't just die of adrenaline shock, we also shipped a massive new gameplay patch, which you might want to read up on. Go find out more about 7.36 [url=https://dota2.com/patches/7.36]here[/url].\n\nWe also shipped the second part of Crownfall, this time taking place in the unforgiving deserts of Druud. There's a new overworld map, a new story, some new characters (and some familiar favorites), new cosmetic items, new minigames, and more than a few surprises.\n\nLastly, in case you got busy last month (it happens) and were wondering if you'll still be able to play Crownfall Act I now that Act II's shipped: You can. All of Crownfall's acts will be available as new acts come online, up to the conclusion of the event.\n\nOK, that's probably enough fishing and fishing-adjacent (7.36, Crownfall Act II) news for one update.  What are you waiting for? Boot up the game and get angling!\n",

Hundreds of item sets have been lovingly crafted, lovingly polished, and lovingly uploaded to the Workshop, and now it's up to you, the Dota community, to lovingly vote on which ones you'd like to see in the next Collector's Cache!\n\nIn the spirit of Dota Labs experimentation, this time voting is open to everyone. From the dashboard, simply click the Collector's Cache Voting button and then upvote or downvote the sets you're the most passionate about. Voting runs from now until May 21st, with the most popular sets getting released as part of a future Crownfall update.",

Missing tokens have been granted to all affected accounts.\n[*] Fixed voice chat indicators not appearing for some players.\n[*] Fixed the in-game Ranked Double Down button not appearing for some players.\n[*] Fixed a bug allowing Shadow Demon to level up his ultimate outside of the correct level points.\n[*] Fixed the Demo Hero mode Target Dummy being unintentionally killable.\n[*] Fixed a bug in the combat log that caused an additional tower killed message to be printed along with tower deny messages.\n[*] Fixed a bug in the combat log that caused barracks kills by creeps being attributed to a player.\n[*] Fixed a bug in the combat log that incorrectly showed no gold being given to all players when barracks were killed by creeps.\n[*] Fixed models shown in loadout or pregame screens not always using the highest quality rendering options.\n[*] Fixed missing visual effects for heroes with the Aviana's Feather neutral item.\n[*] Fixed the Crownfall Snake Charmer encounter to also grant credit when you play two Turbo games.\n[*] Fixed the Crownfall Snake Charmer encounter not greeting players the first time you open it.\n[*] Fixed some minor visual issues with the Drow Ranger The Finer Points taunt.\n[/list]",
