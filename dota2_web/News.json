Approximately half of players at this rank already have an official name registered.\n[*] Players above 8500 MMR who are guaranteed to play an Immortal Draft game may not queue for ranked as a party.

All matches will be private. You're required have an official name registered. You cannot queue for ranked matches as a member of a party.
