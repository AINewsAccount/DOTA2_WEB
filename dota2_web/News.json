Dropping only three games throughout their championship run, this relentless Liquid squad washed away a field of fearsome contenders to resoundingly earn their place as the finest Dota team in the world.\n\nTeam Liquid's journey to the Aegis started smoothly with a pair of 2-0 series wins over Aurora and beastcoast, but a 0-2 showing against defending champions Team Spirit reminded everyone that the path to immortality is filled with formidable foes.\n\nTheir next opponent would only prove that point further. With Liquid holding a 1-0 advantage and the Upper Bracket almost within reach, underdogs BB Team ran away with the second match of their seeding set, threatening Liquid with a much more difficult Lower Bracket path. Undaunted, Liquid leveraged early action in game three to build an avalanching lead and ultimately secure their place in the Upper Bracket to begin the next stage.\n\nOnce there, the eventual champions never looked back. Their heroes were almost unkillable in a dominating 2-0 win over Xtreme Gaming, with only a single death amongst them in game two. Carrying that momentum forward, they opened their series on the main stage against Cloud9 with another stomp. Game two turned into a closer back-and-forth fight, but Liquid rode an epic late game teamwipe to victory and a place in the Upper Bracket Final against a familiar opponent — and constant obstacle in their path — the dangerous Gaimin Gladiators.\n\nFlipping precedent, Liquid withstood Gaimin's early aggression and took the series 2-0, marching convincingly into the Grand Final. After Gaimin battled their way back for a rematch, Team Liquid took the chance to demonstrate that the results of the first matchup were no fluke. They dispatched their old nemesis in decisive 3-0 fashion to secure the Aegis and a place in Dota 2 history.\n\nAs bearers of the ultimate symbol of victory, these names shall forever be inscribed upon the Aegis of Champions:\n\n[b]2024 - Team Liquid[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Michael \"miCKe\" Vu\n[*] Michał \"Nisha\" Jankowski\n[*] Neta \"33\" Shapira\n[*] Samuel \"Boxi\" Svahn\n[*] Aydin \"Insania\" Sarkohi\n[/list]\n\n[b]Looking Back[/b]\n\nWe would like to once again thank all of the players, talent, and everyone in the Dota community for helping bring this global celebration to life. If you missed any of the tournament, or just want to relive the incredible plays, head over to the [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/dota2]Dota 2 YouTube channel[/url], where you can find replays of the entire tournament. You can also find a trove of photos from the event over on the [url=https://www.instagram.com/dota2]Dota 2 Instagram[/url] and [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/dota2ti/]Dota 2 flickr[/url].\n\n[b]Celebrate the Champions[/b]\n\nSpecial Champion edition sticker capsules are now available for purchase for Team Liquid. Each capsule contains one sticker featuring miCKe, Nisha, 33, Boxi, Insania, or Team Liquid. 50% of all sales will go directly to Team Liquid.\n\n[b]The International Compendium[/b]\n\nIf you've still got some challenges to complete and rewards to claim in The International 2024 Compendium, there's a bit more time before it all wraps up. You can still snag additional levels for your Compendium until Tuesday, October 15th, and other goodies like supporters packs, talent bundles, and champion stickers will be available a few weeks longer.\n\n[b]Upcoming Hero and Crownfall Act IV[/b]\n\nAlso, in case you missed the trailer during The International, we announced Dota's next hero. Leader of the flightless, sworn enemy of Queen Imperia, and general troublemaker [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqIFVTc8j80]Kez will be joining the roster of Dota heroes[/url] when Crownfall Act IV releases.",

That's right: The Road to TI's Group Stage is officially underway for The International 2024.\n\nThere's a lot of fun stuff to cover before the event starts, and not a lot of time, so we're gonna stop introducing the information and start the informing. Let's get to it.\n\n[h3]Tournament Streams[/h3]\nGroup Stage is always glorious chaos. This year, almost fifty games will be played in the first two days alone, spread across three streams for each of the four official broadcast languages:\n[list]\n[*][b]English[/b]: Twitch: [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti]Stream A[/url], [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_2]Stream B[/url], [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_3]Stream C[/url]; SteamTV: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/watch/76561198198486997]Stream A[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/watch/76561198239691668]Stream B[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/watch/76561198207546029]Stream C[/url]; YouTube: [url=https://www.youtube.com/@dota2]All Streams[/url]\n[*][b]Spanish[/b]: Twitch: [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_es]Stream A[/url], [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_es_2]Stream B[/url], [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_es_3]Stream C[/url]; Facebook: [url=https://www.facebook.com/dota2]All Streams[/url]; SteamTV: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/watch/76561199212802637]Stream A[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/watch/76561199212713691]Stream B[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/watch/76561199212705375]Stream C[/url]; YouTube: [url=https://www.youtube.com/@dota2]All Streams[/url]\n[*][b]Russian[/b]: Twitch: [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_ru_2]Stream A[/url], [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_ru_3]Stream B[/url], [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_ru_4]Stream C[/url], [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_ru]Multi-Stream[/url]; SteamTV: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/watch/76561198239716708]Stream A[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/watch/76561198207580869]Stream B[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/watch/76561198321277386]Stream C[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/watch/76561198207552741]Multi-Stream[/url]; YouTube: [url=https://www.youtube.com/@dota2]All Streams[/url]\n[*][b]Chinese[/b]: Twitch: [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_cn]Stream A[/url], [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_cn_2]Stream B[/url], [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_cn_3]Stream C[/url]; SteamTV: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/watch/76561198208088121]Stream A[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/watch/76561198208089225]Stream B[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/watch/76561198208096163]Stream C[/url]; Bilibili: [url=https://live.bilibili.com/46936]Stream A[/url], [url=https://live.bilibili.com/46937]Stream B[/url], [url=https://live.bilibili.com/312785]Stream C[/url]\n[/list]\nAfter Group Stage wraps up, starting Friday, September 6th, both The Road to the International and The International itself will broadcast on one stream per official language:\n[list]\n[*][b]English[/b]: [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti]Twitch[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/watch/76561198198486900]SteamTV[/url], [url=https://www.youtube.com/@dota2]YouTube[/url]\n[*][b]Spanish[/b]: [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_es]Twitch[/url], [url=https://www.facebook.com/dota2/videos]FaceBook[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/watch/76561199212802637]SteamTV[/url], [url=https://www.youtube.com/@dota2]YouTube[/url]\n[*][b]Russian[/b]: [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_ru]Twitch[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/watch/76561198239716708]SteamTV[/url],  [url=https://www.youtube.com/@dota2]YouTube[/url]\n[*][b]Chinese[/b]: [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_cn]Twitch[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/watch/76561198208088121]SteamTV[/url], [url=https://live.bilibili.com/46936]Bilibili[/url]\n[/list]\nIf you're looking for [i]unofficial[/i] languages, we've got those, too. We've handed out more than a dozen broadcast licenses, ranging from Bulgarian to Vietnamese, so check in with your local Dota community to find the best way to watch online.\n\nAnd as always, anyone is welcome to join in on the streaming fun. We only ask that you follow our [url=https://www.dota2.com/dotatv]community streaming guidelines[/url].\n\n[h3]The Secret Shop[/h3]\nThe International Secret Shop is once again open for business. We've got everything from mouse pads to jerseys to a real-life Toy Pudge plush, and so much more. There are two separate storefronts — We Are Nations offers both [url=https://na.dota2secretshop.com/]US deliveries[/url] and [url=https://int.dota2secretshop.com/]international deliveries[/url], and Perfect World offers [url=https://wmsjdj.tmall.com]domestic China deliveries[/url] and [url=https://pwrdesports.aliexpress.com/]international deliveries[/url].\n\n[h3]Tickets and Badges[/h3]\nGround-floor tickets for The International have sold out, and even arena seats are mostly gone, but there are still [url=https://www.ticketmaster.dk/artist/941884]a few left[/url].\n\nFor attendees:[list]\n[*]Your Ticketmaster ticket can be used for re-entry. Just remember to scan out as you leave so you can re-enter later in the day if you’d like.\n[*]Each day of the event, you'll get a new commemorative badge with a unique code that can be registered to your Steam account for potential Crimson Witness treasure drops. (The URL for registration is on the badge.)[/list]\n[h3]What Else?[/h3]\nThat's it for now. Honestly, that was a lot of information, and we're not going to lie, there might even be more on the way. But for now, don't worry about it. Just sit back, relax, and reread this blog post until you can recite it phonetically. We'll be calling everyone personally to verify you've got it memorized. You got this! Talk soon.\n\n",
