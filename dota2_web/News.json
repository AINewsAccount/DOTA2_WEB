And he will change the history of Skywrath forever.\n\nThis is not that story. Not yet.

Dropping only three games throughout their championship run, this relentless Liquid squad washed away a field of fearsome contenders to resoundingly earn their place as the finest Dota team in the world.\n\nTeam Liquid's journey to the Aegis started smoothly with a pair of 2-0 series wins over Aurora and beastcoast, but a 0-2 showing against defending champions Team Spirit reminded everyone that the path to immortality is filled with formidable foes.\n\nTheir next opponent would only prove that point further. With Liquid holding a 1-0 advantage and the Upper Bracket almost within reach, underdogs BB Team ran away with the second match of their seeding set, threatening Liquid with a much more difficult Lower Bracket path. Undaunted, Liquid leveraged early action in game three to build an avalanching lead and ultimately secure their place in the Upper Bracket to begin the next stage.\n\nOnce there, the eventual champions never looked back. Their heroes were almost unkillable in a dominating 2-0 win over Xtreme Gaming, with only a single death amongst them in game two. Carrying that momentum forward, they opened their series on the main stage against Cloud9 with another stomp. Game two turned into a closer back-and-forth fight, but Liquid rode an epic late game teamwipe to victory and a place in the Upper Bracket Final against a familiar opponent — and constant obstacle in their path — the dangerous Gaimin Gladiators.\n\nFlipping precedent, Liquid withstood Gaimin's early aggression and took the series 2-0, marching convincingly into the Grand Final. After Gaimin battled their way back for a rematch, Team Liquid took the chance to demonstrate that the results of the first matchup were no fluke. They dispatched their old nemesis in decisive 3-0 fashion to secure the Aegis and a place in Dota 2 history.\n\nAs bearers of the ultimate symbol of victory, these names shall forever be inscribed upon the Aegis of Champions:\n\n[b]2024 - Team Liquid[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Michael \"miCKe\" Vu\n[*] Michał \"Nisha\" Jankowski\n[*] Neta \"33\" Shapira\n[*] Samuel \"Boxi\" Svahn\n[*] Aydin \"Insania\" Sarkohi\n[/list]\n\n[b]Looking Back[/b]\n\nWe would like to once again thank all of the players, talent, and everyone in the Dota community for helping bring this global celebration to life. If you missed any of the tournament, or just want to relive the incredible plays, head over to the [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/dota2]Dota 2 YouTube channel[/url], where you can find replays of the entire tournament. You can also find a trove of photos from the event over on the [url=https://www.instagram.com/dota2]Dota 2 Instagram[/url] and [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/dota2ti/]Dota 2 flickr[/url].\n\n[b]Celebrate the Champions[/b]\n\nSpecial Champion edition sticker capsules are now available for purchase for Team Liquid. Each capsule contains one sticker featuring miCKe, Nisha, 33, Boxi, Insania, or Team Liquid. 50% of all sales will go directly to Team Liquid.\n\n[b]The International Compendium[/b]\n\nIf you've still got some challenges to complete and rewards to claim in The International 2024 Compendium, there's a bit more time before it all wraps up. You can still snag additional levels for your Compendium until Tuesday, October 15th, and other goodies like supporters packs, talent bundles, and champion stickers will be available a few weeks longer.\n\n[b]Upcoming Hero and Crownfall Act IV[/b]\n\nAlso, in case you missed the trailer during The International, we announced Dota's next hero. Leader of the flightless, sworn enemy of Queen Imperia, and general troublemaker [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqIFVTc8j80]Kez will be joining the roster of Dota heroes[/url] when Crownfall Act IV releases.",
