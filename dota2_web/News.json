(The correct rank change was recorded on the server, this was just a display issue.)\n[*] Fixed Crownfall Ranked Double Down tokens beyond the first not being correctly granted. Missing tokens have been granted to all affected accounts.\n[*] Fixed voice chat indicators not appearing for some players.\n[*] Fixed the in-game Ranked Double Down button not appearing for some players.\n[*] Fixed a bug allowing Shadow Demon to level up his ultimate outside of the correct level points.\n[*] Fixed the Demo Hero mode Target Dummy being unintentionally killable.\n[*] Fixed a bug in the combat log that caused an additional tower killed message to be printed along with tower deny messages.\n[*] Fixed a bug in the combat log that caused barracks kills by creeps being attributed to a player.\n[*] Fixed a bug in the combat log that incorrectly showed no gold being given to all players when barracks were killed by creeps.\n[*] Fixed models shown in loadout or pregame screens not always using the highest quality rendering options.\n[*] Fixed missing visual effects for heroes with the Aviana's Feather neutral item.\n[*] Fixed the Crownfall Snake Charmer encounter to also grant credit when you play two Turbo games.\n[*] Fixed the Crownfall Snake Charmer encounter not greeting players the first time you open it.\n[*] Fixed some minor visual issues with the Drow Ranger Shooting Gallery taunt.\n[/list]",

Eagle-eyed players noticed that they come from the same town, seem to have related backstories, and might even be dating. Pretty mysterious stuff.\n\nEarlier, we dropped a comic that solved those mysteries, but introduced an even bigger one: \"Why are you posting comics instead of updates?\"\n\nWe can now reveal the answer: Because we've just released The Markets of Midgate, the first act of an ongoing story event called Crownfall, filled with legendary heroes and unique rewards. In this act alone, you can expect dozens of new cosmetic sets, taunts, creeps, emoticons... are we forgetting anything? Oh right, and two brand-new Arcana, one for each of Crownfall's main characters.\n\nSo what is Crownfall? It's something completely new that we've wanted to try for a while. And when we say new, we mean [i]new[/i]â€” a new way of telling stories, offering rewards, and making it more fun to win every game of Dota. And it's available right now to all Dota players for free.\n\nHonestly, it's a little hard to describe in a tiny blog post. But luckily, the description is exactly website-sized. Go read the details [url=https://www.dota2.com/crownfall]here[/url]. Or, if you'd rather just play instead of hearing us describe it, boot up the game and enter the world of Crownfall for yourself.",
