After a year of mixed results, Team Falcons finally soared to the Aegis of Champions in Hamburg — by clawing, scrapping, and grinding through one of the grittiest marathons The International has ever seen. Of their ten series, only three were sweeps. Every other battle went the distance, including a five-game Grand Final.\n\nFalcons established themselves early with 2-1 wins over Nemesis and Tundra. Their first stumble came against Xtreme Gaming in a three-hour slugfest. Falcons ultimately fell, but their resilience was on full display. Next, they wiped away Team Liquid 2-0, but the following series against Tidebound was much more turbulent. Falcons lost, and suddenly elimination was looming. Their opponent in the elimination round? Team Spirit, the tournament favorites. The Result? A 2-0 statement from Falcons that sent the perennial powerhouse packing. Team Falcons had found their wings just in time for the main stage.\n\nThey opened in Barclays Arena with a vengeance: a 2-0 sweep over Tidebound. Against BB Team, Falcons dropped the first match. Instead of playing it safe, they leaned into an aggressive draft to win game two. In game three, Falcons quickly put BB into a chokehold. PVISION was next. Falcons absorbed a painful stomp in game one, but rolled away with game two to even the set. To cap it off in game three, Falcons punched their ticket to the Grand Final by delivering an hour-long triumph that had the crowd roaring at the events on stage.\n\nTo claim the Aegis of Champions on the final day, Team Falcons would need to defeat the only other team that had beaten them. Xtreme Gaming had survived an intense lower bracket final to set up a fitting rematch. In the first game, Xtreme carved Falcons apart. Falcons answered right back with a stunning beatdown in the next one. Game three seemed evenly matched — until a game-turning team wipe pushed Falcons into a 1-2 series hole. They clawed back in game four to stave off elimination and force a decisive game five.\n\nIn the decider, a strong draft from Falcons unleashed a disruptive combo into the fray, and from minute 15 onward they took control of the map. Xtreme Gaming made a valiant effort at defense, but in the end Team Falcons tore into the enemy heroes and smashed down the Ancient — and the Aegis of Champions was theirs to claim.\n\nAs bearers of the ultimate symbol of victory, these names shall forever be inscribed upon the Aegis of Champions:\n\n[b]2025 - Team Falcons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Oliver \"skiter\" Lepko\n[*]Stanislav \"Malr1ne\" Potorak\n[*]Ammar \"AMMAR_THE_F\" Alassaf\n[*]Andreas \"Cr1t-\" Nielsen\n[*]Jingjun \"Sneyking\" Wu\n[/list]\n\n[b]Looking Back[/b]\nLike Dota itself, The International is an awe-inspiring mixture of countless moving parts.

If you're not one of them, there's no better time than now to dig in. Because as you read this, final preparations are well underway in Hamburg, Germany — and The International 2025 is almost here.\n\n[/p][h3]The Road to The International[/h3][p]The Road to The International: Playoffs kick off with sixteen teams vying for the Aegis of Champions, but only eight will survive the first trials on the path to victory.\n\nThe action starts with a five-round Swiss bracket: Over the first three days, sixteen teams will play best-of-three matches against other teams with the same overall series record. A fourth series win will earn a team an automatic berth at The International; a fourth loss will result in elimination.  \n\nAfter five rounds of Swiss, three teams will have secured spots in The International and three teams will have been eliminated. The ten remaining teams will face off in a special elimination round, with the five winners advancing to The International and the five losers failing to join them.  \n\nThis first part of the tournament runs from Thursday, September 4th through Sunday, September 7th, and every series on Sunday carries the threat of elimination.\n\n[/p][h3]The International[/h3][p]The International itself begins Thursday, September 11th in Barclays Arena, running across four days and culminating with the Grand Finals on Sunday, September 14th.\n\nTickets for Saturday and Sunday are sold out, but you can still snag spots for the first two days over on [url=\"https://www.axs.com/teams/1119906/the-international-dota-2-tickets\"]AXS[/url]. Thursday offers the chance to catch the live component of the Opening Ceremony, along with a ton of top-tier Dota. As an added bonus, all eight teams who reach The International will have at least one signing session at the arena on Thursday or Friday. Stop by for a little face time with your favorite squads.\n\nWe'll be back to provide more details about on-site events, badges, Crimson Witness drops and more as we move closer to the show.\n\n[/p][h3]Tournament Streams[/h3][p]If you read all the above, you're well aware there's an immense amount of Dota in store. In fact, it's physically improbable to catch every single game live. That said, we know some of you are going to try it, so here are all the links you need to know for your valiant attempts:\n[/p][list][*][p][b]English[/b]: Twitch: [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti\"]Stream A[/url], [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_2\"]Stream B[/url], [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_3\"]Stream C[/url], [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_4\"]Stream D[/url]; Steam: [url=\"https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/Dota/sale/TheInternational2025\"]All Streams[/url]; YouTube: [url=\"https://www.youtube.com/@dota2\"]All Streams[/url]\n[/p][/*][*][p][b]Spanish[/b]: Twitch: [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_es\"]Stream A[/url], [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_es_2\"]Stream B[/url], [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_es_3\"]Stream C[/url], [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_es_4\"]Stream D[/url]; Facebook: [url=\"https://www.facebook.com/dota2\"]All Streams[/url]; Steam: [url=\"https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/Dota/sale/TheInternational2025\"]All Streams[/url]; YouTube: [url=\"https://www.youtube.com/@dota2\"]All Streams[/url]\n[/p][/*][*][p][b]Russian[/b]: Twitch: [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_ru\"]Stream A[/url], [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_ru_2\"]Stream B[/url], [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_ru_3\"]Stream C[/url], [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_ru_4\"]Stream D[/url]; Steam: [url=\"https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/Dota/sale/TheInternational2025\"]All Streams[/url]; YouTube: [url=\"https://www.youtube.com/@dota2\"]All Streams[/url]\n[/p][/*][*][p][b]Chinese[/b]: Twitch: [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_cn\"]Stream A[/url], [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_cn_2\"]Stream B[/url], [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_cn_3\"]Stream C[/url], [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_cn_4\"]Stream D[/url]; Steam: [url=\"https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/Dota/sale/TheInternational2025\"]All Streams[/url][/p][/*][/list][p]\nWe've also handed out a dozen broadcast licenses to help you connect with your local community and watch together online.\n\n[/p][list][*][p][b]Bahasa Melayu[/b]: [url=\"https://www.youtube.com/@easyonair_official\"]YouTube[/url]\n[/p][/*][*][p][b]Brazilian Portuguese[/b]: [url=\"https://www.youtube.com/@BTSBrasilTV\"]YouTube[/url]\n[/p][/*][*][p][b]Bulgarian[/b]: [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/rubara\"]Twitch[/url]\n[/p][/*][*][p][b]Finnish[/b]: [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/elisaesports\"]Twitch[/url]\n[/p][/*][*][p][b]French[/b]: [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/teamoftilt_tv\"]Twitch[/url]\n[/p][/*][*][p][b]German[/b]: [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/beingesports\"]Twitch[/url]\n[/p][/*][*][p][b]Mongolian[/b]: [url=\"https://www.youtube.com/@mpefederation\"]YouTube[/url]\n[/p][/*][*][p][b]Slovak and Czech[/b]: [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/c1rceezy\"]Twitch[/url], [url=\"https://www.youtube.com/c1RcEEzy\"]YouTube[/url]\n[/p][/*][*][p][b]Tagalog & Bahasa Indonesian[/b]: [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/kuyanicwxc\"]Twitch[/url], [url=\"https://www.facebook.com/kuyanicwxc\"]Facebook[/url],  [url=\"https://www.youtube.com/@kuyanicwxc\"]YouTube[/url],  [url=\"https://kick.com/kuyanic\"]Kick[/url],  [url=\"https://youtube.com/@anonimdt\"]YouTube[/url]\n[/p][/*][*][p][b]Thai[/b]: [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/lightfurylf\"]Twitch[/url], [url=\"https://www.facebook.com/lightfuryth\"]FaceBook[/url], [url=\"https://www.youtube.com/LightFuryLF\"]YouTube[/url]\n[/p][/*][*][p][b]Ukrainian[/b]: [url=\"https://www.twitch.tv/dota2_maincast\"]Twitch[/url], [url=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Dota2_maincast/\"]YouTube[/url]\n[/p][/*][*][p][b]Vietnamese[/b]: [url=\"https://www.youtube.com/@23DotaTV\"]YouTube[/url]\n[/p][/*][/list][h3]The Secret Shops[/h3][p]As some of you may have noticed, WeAreNations already have a ton of new swag available online. \n\nThey have two handy links, depending on where you are:\n[url=\"https://na.dota2secretshop.com/\"][b]NA Store[/b][/url][url=\"https://na.dota2secretshop.com/\"]: https://na.dota2secretshop.com/ [/url]\n[url=\"https://int.dota2secretshop.com/\"][b]International Store[/b][/url][url=\"https://int.dota2secretshop.com/\"]: https://int.dota2secretshop.com/[/url]\n\nOur friends over at Perfect World are also offering a new collection for this year:\n[url=\"https://wmsjdj.world.tmall.com/\"][b]For fans in China[/b][/url][url=\"https://wmsjdj.world.tmall.com/\"]: https://wmsjdj.world.tmall.com/[/url]\n[url=\"https://pwrdesports.aliexpress.com/store/1103775565\"][b]International Store[/b][/url][url=\"https://pwrdesports.aliexpress.com/store/1103775565\"]: https://pwrdesports.aliexpress.com/store/1103775565[/url]\n\nFinally, for those of you with an eye for flashy furniture, our longstanding partner Secretlab will once again be supporting all stages of this year's tournament with both chairs and desks custom built for The International 2025.

The nominees will be available to vote on in the client until Tuesday, September 2. The top ten entries selected by the community will be shown during The International, where we'll also announce the overall winners.\n\nAs mentioned, we'll be back with more badge, treasure, and other event info next week for those heading to the venue to join the fun.
